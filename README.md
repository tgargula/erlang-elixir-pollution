# Pollution module


This is a project for the subject: Programming in Erlang and Elixir.
It implements basic functionalities that could be used for gathering pollution data.


## Build
```shell
rebar3 compile
```

## Elixir
In the [elixir branch](https://github.com/tgargula/erlang-pollution/tree/elixir) I have built an Elixir app based on the
files written in Erlang.
